# A Solent University LaTeX Template


A LaTeX template attempting following Solent's referencing and report writing standards.  

I often find desktop editors such as Microsoft Word seem to have a mind of their own when it comes to formatting documents. 

LaTeX lets you precisely define the layout standards before you start writing. This allows the separation of worrying about the layout and writing the content. 

## How to get started

1.  Download a LaTeX editor
	- [Mac TeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)
	- [Windows TeX Works](https://www.tug.org/texworks/)
2. Clone this repository 
3. The two main file that you'll need to edit are 
	- [sample.bib](sample.bib), the biblatex database containing sources for the document
	- [sample.tex](sample.tex), the majority of your time will be spent here, this is the main file for the project, containing the content.
